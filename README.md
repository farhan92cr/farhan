AWS Zero Hero day 1:

What is DevOps:
I would say devops is a process of improving the application delivery by ensuring there is a proper automation with a code quality that is maintained or with the application quality that is maintained and ensuring there is a continuous monitoring and continuous testing in place. 
Four pillars of devops are:
1. automation
2. quality
3. monitoring
4. testing

develop and test high quality product.


AWS Zero Hero day 13: 

AWS Services that Every DevOps Engineers should learn.

1.  EC2 --> Live Project
2.  VPC --> Virtual Private Cloud -->  securing your AWS resources we use VPC, like ec2 instance, Cidr block, inbound traffic rules
3.  EBS --> Volume --> we need to know how attach a volum with EC2 instance. --> EC2 has by default storage,
    it better to store the information into volume mounts, so we can easiy attach, deattach them.
4. S3 --> (Storage) , it save file and folder like google drive.
5. IAM  user --> (identity and access managemnet) --> the aws service that takes care of identity and access management is AWS IAM.
6. Cloud watch --> cloudwatch takes care of monitoring and observing
7. Lambda -->
   now coming to Lambda like I told it's a serverless computer now what is the difference between Lambda and ec2 if I am
   saying that using Lambda I can execute some action and I am calling it serverless whereas ec2 is by default a compute service which has a server
   what is the difference so the difference here is that AWS Lambda functions you know they can be created and paid on automatically
   like you don't have to do anything from your end like for example you go ahead and create a ec2 instance from the AWS console but whenever
   you want to use AWS Lambda you can directly like you know run the program or you know you can execute your Lambda function and AWS
   will automatically okay even without your request like you it will not ask you do you want a Ubuntu underneath or do you
   want for example do you want a red hat or you want send OS what AWS will do is it will take your action it will take your
   code automatically it will create an instance for you it will execute the code on the instance and once the execution is done it will tear down
   the instance okay so Lambda are serverless computes which are used for short actions okay unless you're easy to instance in your
   ec2 instance what you'll do you will deploy your application whereas Lambda are used for executing this short what actions or this short
   functionalities that can be teared on and like you know executed and teared on automatically.
